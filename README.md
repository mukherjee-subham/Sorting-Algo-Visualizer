# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
A simple sorting algorithm visualiser with the help of Javascript promise &amp; async function as well as basic Bootstrap CSS for quick styling.

## To-be-done
Have to add media queries for mobile devices and scale the rendering of bars with respect to %vw and %vh or at least rem and em, not px.
Works best on Chrome.
May add a dark-mode/light-mode button.
Still have to add the functionality for Quick Sort.

-> I hope you have as much fun playing around with it as I had while implementing it.

For all the algorithms, the unaccessed/unsorted elements are cyan in colour, and the sorted ones are yellow.
Use the size slider to dynamically change size of the array and new array button to randomize the array.
When ready, use a sorting button to see it's demonstration.
Have fun :))
